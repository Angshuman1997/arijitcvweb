  "description": [
    "As a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate, I bring a strong foundation in CAD design and technical drafting. My academic journey and internship experiences have equipped me with hands-on expertise in creating detailed 2D drawings and sophisticated 3D models for various mechanical components and assemblies.",
    "I'm proficient in industry-standard CAD software including AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and CATIA. My skill set extends to GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing), sheet metal design, and assembly modeling. I'm committed to delivering accurate, manufacturable designs that meet engineering specifications and quality standards."
